# Energy Consumption Prediction (AWS + Spark + Docker)

## Abstract

This project presents an energy consumption forecasting system developed for **CS 643 Cloud Computing Programming Assignment 2**, leveraging **Apache Spark** on **Amazon AWS**. It includes parallel model training across multiple EC2 instances, a streamlined single-instance prediction application, and a **Docker** container for seamless deployment. Powered by a **Gradient Boosted Trees** regression model from **Spark MLlib**, the system is trained on `TrainingDataset.csv` and validated with `ValidationDataset.csv`.

The [**full project report**](./Project_Report.pdf) provides a detailed guide for configuring the cloud infrastructure, executing training and prediction workflows, deploying the Docker container, and evaluating the role of AI tools (ChatGPT) in the development process.
